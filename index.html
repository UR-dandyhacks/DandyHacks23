      <h2>What is DandyHacks?</h2>
      <p>
        DandyHacks is the University of Rochester’s annual 42-hour long
        hackathon. This year will be our 11th anniversary, and we’re so excited
        to hold this amazing milestone in-person! As a fully student-led
        organization at a tier 1 research university, we embody our school’s
        values, encouraging participants to question the world and learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
        DandyHacks is very beginner-friendly, and we welcome students from all
        backgrounds and majors. Participating in DandyHacks is not just about
        winning; it is about collaborating with peers, learning from mentors,
        and gaining valuable experiences. This year, DandyHacks will take place
        on Oct 14-16 in the Feldman Ballroom. We hope to see you there!
